<h1>Internship Projects I've worked on includes:</h1>

<h3>1. Predicting Concrete Strength</h3><br>
 -  The dataset contains the different factors that can affect the compressive strength of concrete.<br>
    The target is to use those factors to predict the compressive strength of the concrete.<br>
 -  Techniques I used includes, hyperparameter tuning, Data preprocessing, and Feature Selection.<br>
 -  XGB and RF Regressor proved to give out the best outcomes<br>
  
<h3>2. Predicting Heart Disease </h3> <br>
 - The dataset is an excerpt from a study of heart disease which contains various measurements on patient health and cardiovascular statistics.<br>
   The target is to predict if a patient has any cardiovascular disease or not.<br>
 - I modeled the algorithm to check the performance with and without outliers<br>
 - Since the outcome are almost the same, we tried to use stacking Classifier which worked best as the working model across Part 1 and Part 2.<br>
   The train and test evaluations are not overfitting and also has the less standard deviations with regards to "Generalization"<br>
 - The recommendation are soley based on the evaluation of the models, however the final decision can be taken with the help of Domain Experts. <br>
<h3>3. RiceLeaf Diseases</h3> <br>
 - The dataset contains images of rice leaf. There are three classes/diseases:<br>
   Bacterial leaf blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut, each having 40 images.<br>
 - I modeled the dataset using CNN using Relu Activation and stopped on:<br>
  <b> Train Accuracy: 93%</b><br>
  <b> Test Accuracy: 91%</b><br>
<h3>4. Flight Price Prediction</h3>
   -Still on progress
